The program is written with a Mortal Kombat Universe theme. Raiden and Shao Kahn are "Managers"
The good guys and bad guys respectively are "Employees"

Employees can log in to submit requests to their managers for reimbursement for bodily injury aka(fatalities ect) or
for other reasons.

Managers can also log in to approve or deny those requests. Both managers and employees can view and update their information
in the database.
